

I ate pav bhaji all my life but can still not forget the one I had in Mumbai. I think next time I go home, I will make a trip to Mumbai only for the food!

I have never met anyone who doesn’t like pav bhaji and even if I meet someone who doesn’t like it, I will be very surprised. It’s soooo good and tasty, how can you not love it?

How to Make Pav Bhaji
There are 2 parts to this pav bhaji recipe – the pav and the bhaji.

The Pav: is basically eggless dinner rolls. You can find them at Indian grocery stores or if you are up for it, here is the recipe to make it at home – Ladi Pav.

If  you can’t find pav and don’t want to make them at home either, regular burger buns or dinner rolls would also do.

The Bhaji: is a spicy blend of mashed veggies. To make bhaji, we first boil the veggies and then cook them with onion, tomatoes, garlic, ginger and a special blend of spices known as pav bhaji masala.

You may add any vegetable you want to your bhaji  but potatoes form the base of bhaji. Other veggies which are commonly added to bhaji are cauliflower, green peas, carrots and green pepper.

The boiled veggies are cooked with a special blend of spices known as pav bhaji masala.

You can get this masala easily at any Indian store. It’s a blend of spices like coriander, cumin seeds, fennel, cinnamon, amchur (dried mango powder) and more.

I prefer Everest brand of pav bhaji masala, but you may use whatever you like!

If you can’t find Pav Bhaji Masala, here’s a quick recipe to make it at home.

Homemade Pav Bhaji Masala
To make pav bhaji masala, you would need

4 tbsp coriander seeds (20 grams)
2 tbsp cumin seeds (18 grams)
5 dried red chilies (3-4 grams), adjust to taste
8 cloves
1 tbsp fennel seeds (9 grams)
3 black cardamom
1 cinnamon stick, around 2 inches
1.5 tsp turmeric powder (6 grams)
2 tsp ground black pepper (6 grams)
1.5 tbsp amchur (18 grams)
½ tsp ground ginger (1 gram)
2 tsp black salt (12 grams)
Dry roast coriander seeds, cumin seeds, dried red chilies, cloves, fennel seeds, black cardamom and cinnamon stick in a pan on medium heat until fragrant, around 3-4 minutes.

Let it cool and then transfer spices to a spice grinder. Stir turmeric powder, ground black pepper, amchur, ground ginger and black salt.

Grind until powdered and well combined. Store pav bhaji masala in an airtight container at room temperature and use as required. This makes around 100 grams of pav bhaji masala.

Tips to Make the Best Pav Bhaji Recipe!
✓ use lots of butter and kasuri methi

✓ a generous squeeze of lemon juice is must before serving

✓ when toasting the pav/bun, add a pinch of pav bhaji masala and kasuri methi to the butter and then toast the pav

✓ don’t forget the chopped onions while serving the pav bhaji!

 

Method
1- Boil the veggies first and keep them ready.

2- Heat 1 tablespoon of butter and oil in a large pot on medium heat. Once the butter melts and oil is hot, add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle.

3- Add the chopped onions and mix. I like to use my food processor to chop them really fine.

4- Cook the onions for around 4 minutes until golden brown in color. Add the finely chopped ginger, garlic and green chili. Again, I used my food processor to chop them really fine.

Cook the ginger-garlic-green chili for 1 minute.


5- Add chopped tomatoes and mix well. Let the tomatoes cook for 2 minutes.

6- Add tomato puree, 1/4 cup water and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cover the pan and let the tomato cook for 6 minutes until softened and completely cooked.

7- Add the pav bhaji masala, red chili powder and remaining 1 teaspoon of salt. You may also add 1/2 teaspoon of sugar here (optional).

8- Mix well and then add in 2 teaspoons of kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves).


9- Stir in the boiled veggies and mix.

10- Using a potato masher, mash the veggies until they are completely mixed with the masala.

11- Add the remaining 3/4 – 1 cup water and mix. I used an immersion blender to blend the veggies to a paste like consistency, this is optional. You may keep them as such.

Cover the pot and set heat to low. Let the bhaji simmer on low heat for 15 minutes.

12- Open the pot and add in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter.


13- Add a generous amount of chopped cilantro.

14- Then add in juice of 1 large lemon. Let the bhaji simmer for 2 more minutes and then remove pan from heat.

15- To toast the pav, melt butter on a pan. Sprinkle some pav bhaji masala on top of the butter and then place the buns on the pan.

16- Press to toast the pav until crisp and golden brown from both sides.


To serve the pav bhaji, place ladle full of bhaji in a plate. Top the bhaji with a dollop of butter. Serve with 2 pavs and a side of chopped onions and a lemon wedge.

I like to serve with lots of onions on the sides, it tastes really amazing that way!
